                    <section>
                    <p><strong>Hayden Silas Anhedönia</strong> (born <time datetime="1998-03-24">March 24, 1998</time>), known professionally as <strong>Ethel Cain</strong>, is an American singer-songwriter, multidisciplinary artist, and model born in Tallahassee, Florida, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, and living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
                    </p>

                    <p>In mid-2017, Cain began experimenting with writing, recording, and producing her own ethereal style, inspired by Christian music and Gregorian chants. She released multiple mixtapes and EPs on streaming platforms under various aliases, as well as to sites like SoundCloud and Tumblr, before adopting a more alternative sound and officially starting the Ethel Cain project in mid-2019. Cain's lyrics focus on nostalgic and Southern Gothic themes, such as poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence, death, and transgenerational trauma. Her music has been associated with the ambient, alternative rock, and dream pop genres.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2022, Cain released her debut studio album, Preacher's Daughter, <strong>to widespread acclaim from music critics—many of whom called it one of the best albums of the year. </strong> Following its release, Cain garnered a cult following online.
                    </p>

                        <h2 id="early">Early Life</h2>
                         <p>Cain was raised in Perry, Florida, the eldest of four children in a Southern Baptist family. Her father was a deacon and she was involved in the church choir from a young age. At age eight, Cain began studying classical piano, and her early musical influences included Karen Carpenter, the Steve Miller Band, and a variety of Christian music. She was homeschooled her entire life. As a teenager, she discovered pop music, particularly those by <strong>Florence and the Machine.</strong></p>

<p>She came out as gay to her family at the age of 12 and left the church at the age of 16. On her 20th birthday, she publicly came out as a trans woman. <em> <blockquote cite="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/ethel-cain-preachers-daughter-album-interview">"It was made clear to everyone that I was not like other people. Whenever I started to develop, I started to come into my own as a trans woman. We were a house divided—it was me versus my whole town."</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Cain finds inspiration from <strong>gospel music, country music, classic rock and alternative music</strong>.</p>
