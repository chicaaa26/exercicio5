            <section>
                <p><strong>Hayden Silas Anhedönia</strong> (born <time datetime="1998-03-24">March 24, 1998</time>),
                    known professionally as <strong>Ethel Cain</strong>, is an American singer-songwriter,
                    multidisciplinary artist, and model born in Tallahassee, Florida, <abbr
                        title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, and living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
                </p>

                <p>In mid-2017, Cain began experimenting with writing, recording, and producing her own ethereal style,
                    inspired by Christian music and Gregorian chants. She released multiple mixtapes and EPs on
                    streaming platforms under various aliases, as well as to sites like SoundCloud and Tumblr, before
                    adopting a more alternative sound and officially starting the Ethel Cain project in mid-2019. Cain's
                    lyrics focus on nostalgic and Southern Gothic themes, such as poverty, substance abuse, domestic
                    violence, death, and transgenerational trauma. Her music has been associated with the ambient,
                    alternative rock, and dream pop genres.
                </p>
                <p>In 2022, Cain released her debut studio album, Preacher's Daughter, <strong>to widespread acclaim
                        from music critics—many of whom called it one of the best albums of the year. </strong>
                    Following its release, Cain garnered a cult following online.

                <h2 id="early">✟ Early Life</h2>
                <p>Cain was raised in Perry, Florida, the eldest of four children in a Southern Baptist family. Her
                    father was a deacon and she was involved in the church choir from a young age. At age eight, Cain
                    began studying classical piano, and her early musical influences included Karen Carpenter, the Steve
                    Miller Band, and a variety of Christian music. She was homeschooled her entire life. As a teenager,
                    she discovered pop music, particularly those by <strong>Florence and the Machine.</strong></p>

                <p>She came out as gay to her family at the age of 12 and left the church at the age of 16. On her 20th birthday, she publicly came out as a trans woman. <em>
                        <blockquote
                            cite="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/ethel-cain-preachers-daughter-album-interview">"It
                            was made clear to everyone that I was not like other people. Whenever I started to develop,
                            I started to come into my own as a trans woman. We were a house divided—it was me versus my
                            whole town."</blockquote>
                    </em></p>

                <p>Cain finds inspiration from <strong>gospel music, country music, classic rock and alternative
                        music</strong>.</p>

                <p>In 2017, while considering enrolling in the Florida State University film school, Cain began
                    experimenting with creating reverb-heavy choral inspired music on GarageBand. From 2017 to 2018, she
                    released her works to a small group of friends and followers on sites such as <del><em>

                    Atlas (stylized as ΛTLΛS). In 2019, following the release of her debut single as Ethel Cain, titled
                    "Bruises", she connected with artist Nicole Dollanganger through social media, opening for
                    Dollanganger on the artist's Heart Shaped Bed tour in Chicago.</p>
